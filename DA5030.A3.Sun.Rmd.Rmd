# Case Study: Detecting Prostate Cancer
## Step 1. Data Collection & Step 2. Preparing and exploring the data
```{r }
setwd("/Users/sunmengyue/Dropbox/2. Northeastern Unviersity/Fall2018/DA 5030 DataMining and Machine Learning/Assignment3") #set the working directory
prc <- read.csv("prostate_cancer (1).csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) #import the data
str(prc) #check the data structure
```
remove the first column, id and add an diagnosis column:
```{r }
prc <- prc[-1] 
head(prc)
table(prc$diagnosis_result) #check how many cases under each value of the diagnosis_result column
prc$diagnosis <- factor(prc$diagnosis_result, levels = c("B", "M"), labels = c("Benign", "Malignant"))
round(prop.table(table(prc$diagnosis)) * 100, digits = 1) #result in the percentage form will round to 1 decimal point
```

Normalizing Numeric Data
```{r }
#create a function naming "normalize"
normalize <- function(x) {
  return( (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)) )
} 

prc_n <- as.data.frame(lapply(prc[2:9], normalize)) #apply the normalize function to the 2nd to 9th column of the original data and transform it into a data frame
summary(prc_n$radius)
```

Create Training and Test Dataset
```{r }
prc_train <- prc_n[1:65, ]
prc_test <- prc_n[66:100, ]
```

Create the Outcome Variables
```{r}
prc_train_labels <- prc[1:65, 1]
prc_test_labels <- prc[66:100, 1]
```

##Step 3. Training a Model on Data
```{r }
library(class)
prc_test_pred <- knn(train = prc_train, test = prc_test, cl = prc_train_labels, k = 10)
```

##Step 4. Evaluate the Model Performance
```{r }
library(gmodels)
CrossTable(x = prc_test_labels, y = prc_test_pred, prop.chisq = FALSE)
```
The test data is consisted of 35 observations, among which 7 cases have been accurately predicted  as Benign (B) (true negative, TN) which constitutes 20% (7/35). Meanwhile, 15 out of the 35 observations were accurately predicted as Malignant (M) (true positive, TP) in nature which constitutes 42.9% (15/35). 

There was 1 case of False Negatives (FN), referring to the case actually is malignant in nature but was predicted as benign. The FN rate is 2.9% (1 / 35). The main focus it to reduce the FN and increase the accuracy of the model. 

There were 12 cases of False Positives (FP),  meaning that there are 12 cases were actually benign in nature but were predicted as malignant.

The total accuracy of the model is 62.9 %( (15 + 7)/35). There might be a chance to improve the model performance.

## Step 5. Improve the Performace of the Model
We are going to try the k value from 8 to 12. Meanwhile, we will try to keep the FN as low as possible and also improve the total accuracy of the model
When k = 8:
```{r }
prc_test_pred8 <- knn(train = prc_train, test = prc_test, cl = prc_train_labels, k = 8)
CrossTable(x = prc_test_labels, y = prc_test_pred8, prop.chisq = FALSE)
```
TN: 8 / 35 = 22.9%
TP: 15 / 35 = 42.9%
FN: 1 / 35 = 2.9%
Total accuracy: (8 + 15) / 35 = 65.7%
When k = 8, the TN increases to 22.9%, the TP, FN are the same as the model of k = 10. The total accuracy increases to 65.7%.

When k = 9
```{r }
prc_test_pred9 <- knn(train = prc_train, test = prc_test, cl = prc_train_labels, k = 9)
CrossTable(x = prc_test_labels, y = prc_test_pred9, prop.chisq = FALSE)
```
TN: 8 / 35 = 22.9%
TP: 16 / 35 = 45.7%
FN: 0
Total accuracy: (8 + 16) / 35 = 68.6%
When k = 9, the TN increases to 22.9%, the TP increases to 45.7%, FN decrease to 0 cases. The total accuracy increases to 68.6%.

When k = 11
```{r }
prc_test_pred11 <- knn(train = prc_train, test = prc_test, cl = prc_train_labels, k = 11)
CrossTable(x = prc_test_labels, y = prc_test_pred11, prop.chisq = FALSE)
```
TN: 5 / 35 = 14.3%
TP: 16 / 35 = 45.7%
FN: 0
Total accuracy: (5 + 16) / 35 = 60%
When k = 11, the TN decreases to 14.3%, the TP increases to 45.7%, FN decrease to 0 cases. The total accuracy decreases to 60%.

When k = 12:
```{r }
prc_test_pred12 <- knn(train = prc_train, test = prc_test, cl = prc_train_labels, k = 12)
CrossTable(x = prc_test_labels, y = prc_test_pred12, prop.chisq = FALSE)
```
TN: 5 / 35 = 14.3%
TP: 16 / 35 = 45.7%
FN: 0
Total accuracy: (5 + 16) / 35 = 60%
When k = 12, all the resutls stay the same as the model of k = 11.
Thus, when k is in the range of 8 to 12, we get the best total accuracy of 68.6%, the lowest FN of 0, when k is 9.

#Using the Caret Package
## Data Slicing
```{r }
library(caret)
set.seed(1221)
intrain <- createDataPartition(y = prc$diagnosis_result, p= 0.7, list = FALSE) #target variable is at V1, not returning a list
training <- prc[intrain, ]
testing <- prc[-intrain, ]
str(training)
str(testing)
```

## Training the Knn Model
```{r }
trctrl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 3)
set.seed(1234)
knn_fit <- train(diagnosis ~., data = training, method = "knn",
                 trControl=trctrl,
                 preProcess = c("center", "scale"),
                 tuneLength = 10)
knn_fit
```
From the knn_fit we can see that , when k = 7, the accruacy is the highest, which is 0.9765. Unlike the previous knn method in the class package, when k = 9 the accruacy reached the maximum. 

``` {r }
test_pred <- predict(knn_fit, newdata = testing)
test_pred
```

## Evaluating the Model with Confusion Matrix
```{r }
 confusionMatrix(test_pred, testing$diagnosis)
```
The overall accuracy is 86.21% with a 95% CI of (0.6834, 0.9611), which is higher than the previous accracy 68.6%.
